# Cognee-RS (Rust Edition)

**Cognee-RS** is a Rust-based experimental SDK for building **on-device AI memory** pipeline in rust.  
It’s designed to run efficiently on constrained devices (smartwatch, phone)

---

## Objectives

- **Small-model support**: The solution has to be able to run with on device models (Phi4 class + embeddings).
- **90+ correctness**: We aim to keep the basic cognee ability to reach similar correctness to Cognee SDK (90+%).
- **On-device vs Cloud ability**:  
  - Transformation tasks + orchestration design should support on-device and cloud mode.  
    - Cloud prep is not the immediate goal, but we’ll keep infra flexibility in mind.
- **Multimodal support**: POC has to support multimodal data ingestion.
- **Retrieval**: Has to be optimally 3-4 sec on a reasonably sized knowledge base.
---

## Orchestration requirements:
- **Memory Control**: Control over the memory used by the ingestion pipeline.
- **CPU control**: Control over threads and parallelization in the ingestion pipeline.
- **Autonomous task scheduling**: Dynamic scheduling of memory-tasks.


## Technology Stack

- **Rust** — We use rust  for the POC.
- **Qdrant** — Qdrant as vector storage.
- **BAML** — llm model management.  
- **Local models** — Phi4
- **Graph store** — We do not use graph database, as we store structure embeddings in the vector collections + optionally retrieve and build relevant subgraphs.
